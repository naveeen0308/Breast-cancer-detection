# **AI Breast Cancer Diagnostic Assistant**

This project implements an **AI-powered Breast Cancer Diagnostic Assistant** leveraging machine learning techniques. It uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset** to classify tumors as malignant or benign. The project is enhanced with a user-friendly **Streamlit-based web interface**, providing interactive insights and predictions.

---

## **Overview**

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early and accurate detection is vital for effective treatment. This project uses the **AdaBoost** algorithm combined with **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** to enhance classification. The tool integrates features like feature importance visualization, real-time predictions, and advanced performance analysis.
